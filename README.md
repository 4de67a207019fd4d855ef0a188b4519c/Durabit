# Durabit
Introducing Durabit, a novel solution that leverages the power of Bitcoin to establish enduring incentive systems for continuous data distribution. This tooling combines time-locked Bitcoin bonds and timestamped torrent magnet links to motivate users to actively participate in the seeding of large files. Durabit not only addresses the initial data propagation challenge but also helps offset the long-term operational costs of seeding files. By marrying the immutability of Bitcoin's blockchain with the efficiency of BitTorrent magnet links, Durabit ensures data availability and integrity while building a self-sustaining incentive system for content distribution.

With its focus on long-term data distribution, Durabit offers a promising platform for content creators, data distributors, and users seeking to engage in the peer-to-peer file-sharing revolution while integrating the immutable state of Bitcoin.
